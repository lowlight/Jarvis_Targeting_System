Base Station
=======================

The Base Station will act as a bridge between the Zigbee network and the Bluetooth connection.  This will allow the app on smartphones (and other devices) to send commands and control the target sensors.  There is/was thought of adding more intelligence to the Base Station but for now it will be a dumb appliance that exists only as a bridge between the two networks.
