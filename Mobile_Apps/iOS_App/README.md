Jarvis_Targeting_System

iOS App
=======================

The Jarvis system is controlled by the iOS app.  this is where the commands for the target sensor LED arrays come from, this is where hits and timings are collected.  Data will be stored in a Google Drive SpreadSheet.  down the road i'm sure this will need to be a DB, but i hate DBs and don't want to worry about it right now. :)
