Target Sensor
=======================

The Target Sensor is a small Audrino device that has a vibration detector to know when a hit on the steel target happened, it will have an LED array connected to it as well.  The Target Sensor will be able to control the LED array.  Right now we are going to keep it simple, so the only LED states are:
all off, RED ON green off, red off GREEN ON, ALL ON.  These 4 states should allow for plenty variation.  Finally the Sensor will have a Zigbee module to allow for network connectivity.
